<h1 style="padding-bottom: 0.5em">Data Science Curriculum</h1>

## Overview

The curriculum presented here curates and organizes resources covering all core aspects of data science. It also includes content on how to learn effectively, mentions of influencers to follow, conferences to attend, links to important books, blogposts, videos, Youtube channels, and encourages one to learn & collaborate with a community of students by means of its own [:fontawesome-brands-discord: Discord channel](https://discord.gg/cfgtzBwDXR) or through joining other existing communities.

Visit the [Resource Hub](/resource_hub) for complementary material on all topics.

!!! info "The challenges of learning data science"

    - There is an unfathomable amount of online resources & books from which to choose from. Where do you start your learning journey? What specific content should you look at? This decision should depend on the quality of the course/book you look at, but also on your current background, education and future goals.
    - How do you know if the course/book you are about to engage in is of high quality? How do you choose between two or more seemingly equivalent, highly rated courses?
    - There is a lack of best in class, frequently updated, curated resources that organizes material found online into a long term learning plan that covers all aspects of data science.
    - A lot of popular curriculums only suggest content from their own platforms. The truth is, the best content on each subject comes from a variety of different sources and comes in many different formats.
    - Often times articles that curate resources suggest too many options from which to choose from. It often resembles a course dump, and it's up to the reader to "guess" which ones are the most relevant for them.
    - Data science is a mix of math, programming, and domain knowledge. How do you know when enough math is enough, or how much software engineering knowledge is needed to get hired?
    - Bootcamps inaccurately make the promise that their students will get hired right after graduating. In most cases, this is only true for people with programming or mathematical backgrounds prior to enrolling. With that in mind, what steps should be taken prior and after taking a bootcamp?

!!! info "Objectives of Open Curriculai"

    The content presented here is an attempt and a first iteration to help people get a better grasp as to how to navigate difficulties mentioned above. Open curricula refers to the fact that the initiative is open source, and that everyone has their optimal curriculum to follow - hence the plural form of the word "Curriculum". 
    
    __Main objectives__:

    - Inspire people who have never programmed but are interested in data science to take the leap and dive into the field. 
    - Assist anyone from total beginner, to bootcamp graduate, and everyone in between, to deepen their knowledge in the field so they can get hired as a data analyst, a data scientist, or a machine learning scientist.
    - Attract experienced practitioners & teachers that are either looking for exceptional data science material or to help and mentor beginners.
    - Incentivise people to discover and work on real world practical projects they are passionate about.
    - Make it easy to find like-minded individuals to connect, study or work with by joining the community.
    - Encourage people to develop skills such as public speaking, writing, creating presentations, and leadership.

!!! tip "Tips"

    - Start with setting up your computer and installing the required tools to do data science effectively. Le Wagon's setup is well maintained and has clear step by step instructions.
    - For those new to programming, start with Harvard’s CS50’s introduction to programming with Python. David Malan is one of the pioneers of online teaching. His content and pedagogical approach is always stellar. This class is new and given for the first time in 2022.
    - For a real challenge, or for those already somewhat familiar with programming, look at CS50’s introduction to Computer Science from the same professor. The exercises are more involved and there is a focus on the C programming language instead of Python. That said, it covers more material and computer science concepts. If you're not taking this course, at least watch [lecture 0 - Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoXxevp1WRQ) for its marvelous introduction to the field of computer science.
    - Since you're about to engage in a long journey of continuous studying, make sure you understand the latest research and science around acquiring knowledge. Taking “Learning how to learn” on Coursera will yield immense benefits long term and give you a competitive advantage over your peers. The book on which the course is based on, “A Mind for Numbers”, and the brilliant “Pragmatic Thinking and Learning” are good complementary options too. For a quick summary of all three resources, refer to [this blogpost](https://julienbeaulieu.github.io/2020/05/25/lesser-known-facts-about-learning-how-to-get-better-at-studying/) or listen to [this podcast by Dr Paul Pen](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/misjudgements-myths-in-learning-with-special-guest-dr/id1523840607?i=1000520771175) for an excellent overview of the subject.
    - Start your data science journey with Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree. This is a great place to start to learn about statistics, probability, data wrangling, data visualization, etc.


### Core Data Science

If you can afford a bootcamp, [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/data-science-course/full-time)** is among the best data science ones out there. There is a heavy emphasis on practical exercises, the curriculum is constantly evolving with the latest libraries and technologies, and the final project involves deploying your own machine learning model.

If you’re not willing to spend as much money, you’re still in luck. Andrew Ng’s notorious [machine learning course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) just got updated! It covers more material than the its predecessor (neural nets are now included) and is very high quality. We recommend taking this course after Udacity’s data Analyst Nanodegree.

Read the indispensible An Introduction to Statistical Learning, 2nd Edition. This book has been updated in 2021 and has been a solid reference in the community for years. We suggest doing the proposed exercises in Python, and not in R.  

Next, have a look at Fastai's lecture on Random Forests (keep the other lectures for when you're studying deep learning). Decision trees and Random Forests are a great baseline for almost any situation and deserve special attention. Jeremie Howard explains them brilliantly.

Pair the above with Andriy Burkov’s famous and succinct The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book, as well as Wes McKinney’s - creator of pandas library - book: Python for Data Analysis (make sure you're reading the latest version, V3, fully available online). One is more focused on theory, while the other is hands-on with Python. They are complementary and will solidify your understanding of all concepts covered so far.

**Topics covered**:
`Data wrangling`
`Data collection with an API`,
`SQL`,
`Statistical tests & experiments`,
`Data visualization`,
`Machine Learning`,
`Deep Learning`,
`Random Forests`,
`Model interpretation techniques`

!!! tip "Tips"

    - If you're struggling with any programming concept in Python, make sure you search for videos of Corey Schafer explaining the subject. His videos are always well-built, clear and enlightening.
    - Familiarize yourself with common data structures and algorithms in Python with Udacitys course which features practice exercises.
    - Complete HackerRank exercises to refine your Python skills with interview-style questions.
    - Once you’re comfortable with the basics of Python - that is to say, after at least 1 year of coding experience - you can slowly start reading Fluent Python for a deep dive on Python core language features and libraries. Note 1: Some of the later chapters are very advanced and optional. Note 2: Keep an eye out for the updated edition of the book which is coming soon.
    - If you still aren't comfortable with the shell, version control (Git) and debugging, watch the lectures from MIT's Missing Semester and do the exercises.
    - For a short and very well explained primer on the basics of Git, we highly recommend [Made with ML's Git guide](https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/git/)

### Core Math

Machine learning is a mix of Statistics, Linear Algebra, Probability, and Calculus. Some say that it’s not strictly necessary to go deep into mathematical theory and that it’s better to focus on coding. While there is some truth to this, if your end goal is to read, write, implement papers, and to be a true expert in data science, then do not neglect math.
The following list of resources will help you both get started if you’re a beginner, or let you go deep down the math rabbit whole if you’re advanced. Remember to practice solving exercises if you want what you're learning to stick.

**Topics covered**:
`Linear algebra`
`statistics`
`Vector calculus`
`Probability`
`and more`

    - Visit the [math Resource Hub section](/resource_hub/math) for a list of complementary learning material.

### Deep Learning

After completing the courses in Core Data Science, and with more solid foundations in programming and machine learning theory, you can move onto deep learning if that’s an area that interests you. It can be tempting to jump straight to this section when you're starting because there are really cool applications to work on. Our POV on this is if this is what really motivates you, try it out and see what you can get out of it. Remember to come back to the sections above however, or you will have gaping holes in your fundamentals which will come back and haunt you down the line.

**Topics covered**:
`Loss functions and optimization`, 
`Convolutional neural networks`,
`Recurrent neural networks`,
`Deep learning hardware and software`,
`Deep learning for tabular data`,
`NLP`,
`Computer vision`,
`Generative models`,

We suggest taking both the Fastai and Deep Learning Specialization courses together since one is more focused on coding while the other is more focused on the theory and math behind it. While you're at it, follow Fastai's course with their book.
    - Both Chirs Maning's and Justin Johnson's (he used to teach the very popular CS231n at Stanford) courses are world class and will give you deep insights into the worlds of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and computer vision. Be sure to do the assignments since they have you code algorithms from scratch and give you a solid foundations to progress further. Both have updated YouTube videos of their 2021 course.
    - The transformer architecture is widely used these days. To get a solid grasp of what they are, be sure to read some of Jay Alammar's blogpost on the subject.
    - Visit the [deep learning Resource Hub section](/resource_hub/deep_learning) for a list of complementary learning material.


### Data Engineering & MLOps

Working on machine learning for a company is usually a lot more involved than just running models inside a Jupyter notebook.

The resources below will get you familiarized with the whole life-cycle of a machine learning system. You'll learn about formulating a problem, ingesting, labeling & cleaning data, building reusable pipelines for each step, deploying a model online and monitoring it, and much more. You'll gain preliminary notions about what it takes to put a model in production. As the field is maturing, knowing about these steps isn't optional anymore for anyone doing machine learning unless you're only doing R&D.

- Regularly explore [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com) to see if there are meetups on topics you are interested in. We have no recommendations since this is location dependant, but since Covid, some meetup groups are now 100% online - you potentially have access to meetups around the world.
- Attend conferences. One we highly suggest going to is [Pycon](https://pycon.org/), even if that means spending a bit of money to attend and travelling to a host city. The value you'll get from it will be worth it in our experience. It is a way for you to be inspired by all that is happening in the world of Python, engineering, and machine learning. Alternatively, you can get an online only ticket for cheaper.
- Participate in a Kaggle competition. Find a competition you're interested in joining - look for ones that are currently open/soon to open. Find teammates to work with, and start coding! Visit the Code section of the competition to read other competitor's notebooks. There are always people sharing interesting work.
- Participate in Hackathons. Keep an eye out for these events happening in your city, or look on meetup.com to find them.
- Actively look for and join communities on Reddit, Discord, and Slack. For instance, subscribe to Reddit's /r/learnmarchinelearning and /r/machinelearning subreddits. Join discord servers to find study groups so that you're not learning alone. Here's the link to our community's [:fontawesome-brands-discord: Discord](https://discord.gg/cfgtzBwDXR)
- Put yourself out there and start writing! Create a personal blog and write articles about what you learned. Your target audience should be people in the same situation you were in 6 months / 1 year ago. 
- Find a meetup group and ask if you can present a subject you've been working on. Do the same within a bunch of different study groups. This will help your oral presentation skills.
- Keep an eye out for recruiting events in your area. Companies are always participating in these events.
- Update your CV and LinkedIn profile to match your studies and personal projects.
- Visit the [career Resource Hub section](/resource_hub/career) for a list of complementary material.
