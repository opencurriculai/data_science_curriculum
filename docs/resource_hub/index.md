![contributing panda](/assets/images/library_panda_400.png){ align=right width="320" }

Welcome to the Resource Hub. It's primary goal is to provide resources of all formats for learning any specialty found in the sidebar. Resources are separated into the following sections:
- Basic theory
- Applied
- Advanced theory
- Advanced applied

There are also resources to help one dive deeper in the topics found in the [curriculum](../curriculum.md). These will help you consolidate what you learned by either giving you an alternative explanation, proposing a different format, or suggesting practice exercises. This is technique is called [interleaving or mixed practice](https://effectiviology.com/interleaving/#:~:text=Interleaving%20is%20a%2).

You are encouraged to regularly visit this section for new content covering the similar or tangent topics since it gets frequently updated.

!!! note

    This section is still in its infancy, so don't hesitate to [contribute](../contributing.md) when you know about or come across great content so that it can be added here.

Refer to this page's sidebar for all sections.
