# Resource Hub

## Overview

Welcome to the Resource Hub. It's primary goal is to provide supporting content to the [curriculum](../Curriculum.md) and help you consolidate what you learned by either giving you an alternative explanation, proposing a different format, or suggesting practice exerises. This is technique is called [interleaving or mixed practice](https://effectiviology.com/interleaving/#:~:text=Interleaving%20is%20a%2).


No matter how good a given resource is, itâ€™s only when we sneak off and look at other material that we begin to see that what we learn through a single teacher or book is a partial version of the full, three-dimensional reality of the subject.

For this reason, resources in the curriculum generally won't be present in the learning hub.
You are encouraged to regularly visit this section for new content covering the similar or tangent topics since it gets frequently updated.

!!! note

    This section is still in its infancy, so don't hesistate to [contribute](../CONTRIBUTING.md) when you come across great content in the future.
