# Open Curriculai

## Overview

This repository contains all files used to create [www.opencurrcul.ai](www.opencurrcul.ai).

All information related to this project can be found on the site.

## Curriculum

Open Curriculai's data science curriculum is a curation of resources that covers all core aspects of data science, and organized them in a way that helps people visualize what a path might look like to become a data scientist.

## Resource Hub

The resource hub contains complementary content to help consolidate concepts learned in various courses and books.

## Approach

Only resources that are judged to be the best on the internet are included. It is a holistic approach to learning data science: there are a lot of resources on how to learn, how to thinking about your career, who to follow on social media, where to find study groups, etc. 

## Contributing

If you know of great pieces of content that aren't included here, feel free to open an issue and propose a new resource. If it's great content, there's a high chance that it'll end up here to help others in their journey.
