This curriculum includes many courses from top universities (MIT, Stanford, University of San Francisco), MOOCs and bootcamps with outstanding reviews (Deeplearning.ai, Fastai, Le Wagon), and content from world class creators in the form of blog posts, videos, and books.</li> <li>Focus on state-of-the-art techniques that you can apply in industry. There aren't many university courses or bootcamps that teach the latest techniques such as those found in Fastai or at Standford's CS224n Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing and then teach you how to deploy them to production.</li> <li>Have the flexibility to learn from anywhere around the world, and continue pursuing your studies part time if you find a job during the process.</li> <li>Become proficient in continuous learning. Following this path will teach you how to be autonomous in how you acquire new skills and rigorous in how you choose new learning material. These resources will accompany you at work and help you tremendously as you progress throughout your career.</li> <li>Put yourself out there and to showcase your work to others. Since you won\u2019t rely on a college degree as a signal to get hired, you\u2019ll be incentivised to create, share, and communicate your best work so that people will know what you are worth. These are essential skills when working at a company.</li> </ul> Does this curriculum offer a certification? <p>People looking for a traditional education and want a diploma should take caution. There are no certifications for completing this curriculum, just the individual ones you'd receive from the courses it lists.</p> What are the requirements for starting? <p>No programming experience is required and rough knowledge of high school math is expected. Also, for those who are committed to pursuing the curriculum end-to-end should already be extremely eager to learn data science, are self-driven and motivated. This requirement is crucial because a lot of the resources listed are self-paced. A high amount of discipline and will are therefore essential.</p> I am interested in a career in academia. Is this path for me? <p>The resources are chosen to prepare you to be up and running for an industry role. Learners interested in a career in academia and R&amp;D should consider enrolling in a university instead.</p> How long will the entire curriculum take to complete? <p>This really depends on your existing background and if it is pursued full time or part time. Completing the curriculum end-to-end can easily take a year and a half full time if you have no prior background in data science. That said, the programme goes much deeper than a bootcamp and will give you more hands-on experience than most master\u2019s degrees.</p> Won't I be disadvantaged during my job search compared to people graduating in data science with a formal degree? <p>While it is true that some companies will instantly disqualify your candidacy because you don't have a college degree, there are more and more people coming into data science with atypical backgrounds that have no formal education in data science. A strong portfolio and a resume showcasing all the requisite skills can go a very long way, especially as the demand for data scientists continues to outpace the rate at which universities can produce them.</p> <p>But make no mistake, this path will require more effort, more dedication, and more self-discipline than if you were to enroll in a computer science or data science degree. While you can sign up for some courses &amp; bootcamps during your journey to have some structure, most studying will be self-paced. You'll also need to spend the extra effort of thinking about and researching what to learn next (hopefully ODSC will help you on that front), and find ways to prove you have the knowledge required to be employed.</p> <p>That said, taking this path is also, in our opinion, more enriching and fulfilling when you'll succeed. If done right, we believe you will be more qualified for an industry job than someone that is graduating from your average data science university program. Lots of employers will recognize the effort it took, and will give you a chance.</p> <p>It is then up to you to demonstrate your skills and to convince your recruiters you have what it takes. Create a blog to write about what you learned and the projects you worked on, open source all the code you wrote on a platform like Github. Communicate about the grit it took to take a self-taught route and succeeding in it. When you feel confident in your abilities, start networking and reach out to your new connections about job opportunities.</p>"},{"location":"about/#contributing","title":"Contributing","text":"Can I contribute to the project and add a resource I find valuable? <p>Yes!

However, if they are videos or blogposts, they should be a series that covers a whole topic.</p> <p>For the purposes of contributing to the curriculum, it is useful to think of a resource in 4 dimensions:</p> <ol> <li>Topic - Ex: Linear Algebra, learning Python.</li> <li>Format - Ex: a course, a book, a video series.</li> <li>Difficulty - Is it catered towards absolute beginners or more towards people with existing experience?</li> <li>Theory vs practicality - Fastai's Practical Deep Learning for Coders is considered, as its named suggests, very practical. For instance, in lecture 1, they already teach you how to create your own dataset and train an image classifier using their library. In lecture 2, you learn how to put it in production.</li> </ol> <p>In general, the curriculum is built in a way that dimensions 1-4 don't overlap with other resources. For example, there is only 1 beginner course on learning Python. Both Deep Learning Specialization &amp; Practical Deep Learning for Coders are introductions to deep learning, but the former will expose more math and theory while the other is more practical. There is also an introductory deep learning book recommendation because the two previous examples were courses.</p> <p>With that in mind, when you are submitting a resource, ask yourself the question if your resource overlaps or not. If not, is it better than the existing one? Why do you think that is the case?</p> <p>Another aspect of the curriculum is to include tips and recommendations as you're progressing such as, \"Find a study group\", or \"participate in a Kaggle competition\". If you have personal tips you would like to share that aren't mentioned, feel free to submit an issue.</p> <p>Guidelines for Contributing to the Resource Hub</p> <p>Generally, the scope of the content pertaining to the Resource Hub is much smaller than those in the curriculum. You will find that most links are single blogposts or videos that help elucidate a topic and present it in a unique and special way. Feel free to also suggest entire lectures or books as well if you think they'll complement the curriculum content well. Add a justification for why in your request.</p> <p>If a topic is missing from the Resource Hub, ensure that the quality of your proposition is high and that is has truly helped you learn a concept. Please explain how that is the case in your request.

Visit the Code section of the competition to read other competitor's notebooks. There are always people sharing interesting work.</li> <li>Participate in Hackathons. Keep an eye out for these events happening in your city, or look on meetup.com to find them.</li> <li>Actively look for and join communities on Reddit, Discord, and Slack. For instance, subscribe to Reddit's /r/learnmarchinelearning and /r/machinelearning subreddits. Join discord servers to find study groups so that you're not learning alone.</li> <li>Put yourself out there and start writing! Create a personal blog and write articles about what you learned. Your target audience should be people in the same situation you were in 6 months / 1 year ago. </li> <li>Find a meetup group and ask if you can present a subject you've been working on. Do the same within a bunch of different study groups. This will help your oral presentation skills.</li> <li>Keep an eye out for recruiting events in your area.
