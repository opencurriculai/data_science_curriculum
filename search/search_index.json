This curriculum is a first step towards that goal. Short Term Broadly, the short-term mission is to democratize data science learning outside of the traditional education route. This is done in a few ways: Macro level The curriculum : manually curated list of the best possible resources from the web through rigorous content auditing for major data science topics. It also includes meta learning resources, and tips on how to get the most out of your learning experience. Data Science learning path : an infographic showcasing what a possible learning path might look like. Micro level A resource hub : Sometimes there is incredible content aimed at explaining, visualizing and understanding specific concepts. Knowing they exist and referring to them in conjunction with a course you are already taking can really help you progress faster. Examples This website that helps visualize probability basics This small essay series by Andrew Ng on how to build a career in AI . A community : a growing community of learners & coaches to help each other along the way, to organize study groups, etc. Open Source Open Curriculai relies on contributions to help patch areas where content is lacking, and to stay updated with constant flow of new content being pushed on the internet. All of the above are works in progress. Long Term Ideally, every individual would be assessed in order to understand what they already know and what their objectives are. A personalized curriculum would then be specifically tailored for them which would evolve with ones preferences. Assessments could also be taken to track progress. People starting out in the field also need coaching, advice, guidance, support, and someone to help them view the bigger picture in order to reach their objectives. In light of this, tools can be created for smart, automatic content discovery, curriculum personalization, and cohort support and management. If you're interested in helping out, have ideas about how to solve the issues, or just want to chat, feel free to reach out on LinkedIn . FAQ Curriculum Questions Why choose a self-taught education? Take advantage of the abundance of high-quality resources available online. This curriculum includes many courses from top universities (MIT, Stanford, University of San Francisco), MOOCs and bootcamps with outstanding reviews (Deeplearning.ai, Fastai, Le Wagon), and content from world class creators in the form of blog posts, videos, and books. Focus on state-of-the-art techniques that you can apply in industry. There aren't many university courses or bootcamps that teach the latest techniques such as those found in Fastai or at Standford's CS224n Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing and then teach you how to deploy them to production. Have the flexibility to learn from anywhere around the world, and continue pursuing your studies part time if you find a job during the process. Become proficient in continuous learning. Following this path will teach you how to be autonomous in how you acquire new skills and rigorous in how you choose new learning material. These resources will accompany you at work and help you tremendously as you progress throughout your career. Put yourself out there and to showcase your work to others. Since you won\u2019t rely on a college degree as a signal to get hired, you\u2019ll be incentivised to create, share, and communicate your best work so that people will know what you are worth. These are essential skills when working at a company. Does this curriculum offer a certification? People looking for a traditional education and want a diploma should take caution. There are no certifications for completing this curriculum, just the individual ones you'd receive from the courses it lists. What are the requirements for starting? No programming experience is required and rough knowledge of high school math is expected. Also, for those who are committed to pursuing the curriculum end-to-end should already be extremely eager to learn data science, are self-driven and motivated. This requirement is crucial because a lot of the resources listed are self-paced. A high amount of discipline and will are therefore essential. I am interested in a career in academia. Is this path for me? The resources are chosen to prepare you to be up and running for an industry role. Learners interested in a career in academia and R&D should consider enrolling in a university instead. How long will the entire curriculum take to complete? This really depends on your existing background and if it is pursued full time or part time. Completing the curriculum end-to-end can easily take a year and a half full time if you have no prior background in data science. That said, the programme goes much deeper than a bootcamp and will give you more hands-on experience than most master\u2019s degrees. Won't I be disadvantaged during my job search compared to people graduating in data science with a formal degree? While it is true that some companies will instantly disqualify your candidacy because you don't have a college degree, there are more and more people coming into data science with atypical backgrounds that have no formal education in data science. A strong portfolio and a resume showcasing all the requisite skills can go a very long way, especially as the demand for data scientists continues to outpace the rate at which universities can produce them. But make no mistake, this path will require more effort, more dedication, and more self-discipline than if you were to enroll in a computer science or data science degree. While you can sign up for some courses & bootcamps during your journey to have some structure, most studying will be self-paced. You'll also need to spend the extra effort of thinking about and researching what to learn next (hopefully ODSC will help you on that front), and find ways to prove you have the knowledge required to be employed. That said, taking this path is also, in our opinion, more enriching and fulfilling when you'll succeed. If done right, we believe you will be more qualified for an industry job than someone that is graduating from your average data science university program. Lots of employers will recognize the effort it took, and will give you a chance. It is then up to you to demonstrate your skills and to convince your recruiters you have what it takes. Create a blog to write about what you learned and the projects you worked on, open source all the code you wrote on a platform like Github. Communicate about the grit it took to take a self-taught route and succeeding in it. When you feel confident in your abilities, start networking and reach out to your new connections about job opportunities. Contributing Can I contribute to the project and add a resource I find valuable? Yes! Absolutely. This is one of the reasons why the curriclum is on GitHub. There are two areas where you can make a resource request: 1. The curriculum, 2. The Resource Hub. Read about how you can contribute here . That said, there is no guarantee that the content you submit will be approved. To keep a high level of quality of the project, and to avoid linking to too many resources, a detailed review of the content submitted will be done to either reject or accept it. The Founder Who wrote this why should you listen to him? My name is Julien Beaulieu, and in early 2019, I decided to quit my job in digital marketing and engage full time in learning data science to transition careers. All university programs I had looked at were first of all, not cheap, and second, due to start only 8 months after I was prepared to make the leap. I was not willing to wait that long to start learning so I enrolled in a few online courses. After several months, I realized the cheer amount of outstanding resources that were at my disposal and the potential there was to build myself a world-class education if I hand picked the best content. I just needed to arrange and organize everything in a way that made sense for my learning goals and interests. Through the pains and lessons learned during my time studying, through auditing tons of courses, books, online content, by looking at other people's curated resource lists, and insipired by amazing open-source initiatives, I have developped this repo; something I would have loved to have when I first started. Inspiration for the Project How was this website built? A very simple approach was taken to build this website: we used a theme called Material for Mkdocs , which is a simple static site generator initially geared towards building source code documentation. There are a lot of customization options available thanks to Markdown extentions . The following website is completely open source and was an inspiration to some of the layout choices: Binbash Leverage . All panda images you'll see on the site are generated by Open Ai. The website's logo was made using Midjourney. Feel free to fork this project and view exactly how this website was made.

You are invited to read and participate to issues and pull requests by responding to proposals and comments. Create a Pull Request Create an issue Contributing Guidelines Guidelines for Contributing to the Curriculum Curriculum resources should span entire subjects and are not abound to a specific format. However, if they are videos or blogposts, they should be a series that covers a whole topic. For the purposes of contributing to the curriculum, it is useful to think of a resource in 4 dimensions: Topic - Ex: Linear Algebra, learning Python. Format - Ex: a course, a book, a video series. Difficulty - Is it catered towards absolute beginners or more towards people with existing experience? Theory vs practicality - Fastai's Practical Deep Learning for Coders is considered, as its named suggests, very practical. For instance, in lecture 1, they already teach you how to create your own dataset and train an image classifier using their library. In lecture 2, you learn how to put it in production. In general, the curriculum is built in a way that dimensions 1-4 don't overlap with other resources. For example, there is only 1 beginner course on learning Python. Both Deep Learning Specialization & Practical Deep Learning for Coders are introductions to deep learning, but the former will expose more math and theory while the other is more practical. There is also an introductory deep learning book recommendation because the two previous examples were courses. With that in mind, when you are submitting a resource, ask yourself the question if your resource overlaps or not. If not, is it better than the existing one? Why do you think that is the case? Another aspect of the curriculum is to include tips and recommendations as you're progressing such as, \"Find a study group\", or \"participate in a Kaggle competition\". If you have personal tips you would like to share that aren't mentioned, feel free to submit an issue. Guidelines for Contributing to the Resource Hub Generally, the scope of the content pertaining to the Resource Hub is much smaller than those in the curriculum. You will find that most links are single blogposts or videos that help elucidate a topic and present it in a unique and special way. Feel free to also suggest entire lectures or books as well if you think they'll complement the curriculum content well. Add a justification for why in your request. If a topic is missing from the Resource Hub, ensure that the quality of your proposition is high and that is has truly helped you learn a concept. Please explain how that is the case in your request. If the topic is already covered, ask yourself what is unique about the way a concept is being explained or in what innovative way is it being presented.","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"contributing/#contributing","text":"Thank you for wanting to contribute!

It also includes content on how to learn effectively, mentions of influencers to follow, conferences to attend, links to important books, blogposts, videos, Youtube channels, and encourages one to learn & collaborate with a community of students by means of its own Discord channel or through joining other existing communities. Visit the Resource Hub for complementary material on all topics. The challenges of learning data science There is an unfathomable amount of online resources & books from which to choose from. Where do you start your learning journey? What specific content should you look at? This decision should depend on the quality of the course/book you look at, but also on your current background, education and future goals. How do you know if the course/book you are about to engage in is of high quality? How do you choose between two or more seemingly equivalent, highly rated courses? There is a lack of best in class, frequently updated, curated resources that organizes material found online into a long term learning plan that covers all aspects of data science. A lot of popular curriculums only suggest content from their own platforms. The truth is, the best content on each subject comes from a variety of different sources and comes in many different formats. Often times articles that curate resources suggest too many options from which to choose from. It often resembles a course dump, and it's up to the reader to \"guess\" which ones are the most relevant for them. Data science is a mix of math, programming, and domain knowledge. How do you know when enough math is enough, or how much software engineering knowledge is needed to get hired? Bootcamps inaccurately make the promise that their students will get hired right after graduating. In most cases, this is only true for people with programming or mathematical backgrounds prior to enrolling. With that in mind, what steps should be taken prior and after taking a bootcamp? Objectives of Open Curriculai The content presented here is an attempt and a first iteration to help people get a better grasp as to how to navigate difficulties mentioned above. Open curricula refers to the fact that the initiative is open source, and that everyone has their optimal curriculum to follow - hence the plural form of the word \"Curriculum\". Main objectives : Inspire people who have never programmed but are interested in data science to take the leap and dive into the field. Assist anyone from total beginner, to bootcamp graduate, and everyone in between, to deepen their knowledge in the field so they can get hired as a data analyst, a data scientist, or a machine learning scientist. Attract experienced practitioners & teachers that are either looking for exceptional data science material or to help and mentor beginners. Incentivise people to discover and work on real world practical projects they are passionate about. Make it easy to find like-minded individuals to connect, study or work with by joining the community. Encourage people to develop skills such as public speaking, writing, creating presentations, and leadership. For more information, make sure to read the About page . Learning Path Example Made with Visme Infographic Maker The Curriculum Explained Data Science Intro & Learning How to Learn The best way to get into data science is to first learn how to program and to gain some familiarity with computer science foundations. Also, since you are about to engage in a lifetime of learning new concepts and skills, viewing the resources related to becoming a better learner is highly recommended. Note: \u2764\ufe0fs represent material we particularly enjoyed and recommend.

Le Wagon's setup is well maintained and has clear step by step instructions. For those new to programming, start with Harvard\u2019s CS50\u2019s introduction to programming with Python. David Malan is one of the pioneers of online teaching. His content and pedagogical approach is always stellar. This class is new and given for the first time in 2022. For a real challenge, or for those already somewhat familiar with programming, look at CS50\u2019s introduction to Computer Science from the same professor. The exercises are more involved and there is a focus on the C programming language instead of Python. That said, it covers more material and computer science concepts. If you're not taking this course, at least watch lecture 0 - Scratch for its marvelous introduction to the field of computer science. Since you're about to engage in a long journey of continuous studying, make sure you understand the latest research and science around acquiring knowledge. Taking \u201cLearning how to learn\u201d on Coursera will yield immense benefits long term and give you a competitive advantage over your peers. The book on which the course is based on, \u201cA Mind for Numbers\u201d, and the brilliant \u201cPragmatic Thinking and Learning\u201d are good complementary options too. For a quick summary of all three resources, refer to this blogpost or listen to this podcast by Dr Paul Pen for an excellent overview of the subject.

Visit the Resource Hub for complementary material on all topics. The challenges of learning data science There is an unfathomable amount of online resources & books from which to choose from. Where do you start your learning journey? What specific content should you look at? This decision should depend on the quality of the course/book you look at, but also on your current background, education and future goals. How do you know if the course/book you are about to engage in is of high quality? How do you choose between two or more seemingly equivalent, highly rated courses? There is a lack of best in class, frequently updated, curated resources that organizes material found online into a long term learning plan that covers all aspects of data science. A lot of popular curriculums only suggest content from their own platforms. The truth is, the best content on each subject comes from a variety of different sources and comes in many different formats. Often times articles that curate resources suggest too many options from which to choose from. It often resembles a course dump, and it's up to the reader to \"guess\" which ones are the most relevant for them. Data science is a mix of math, programming, and domain knowledge. How do you know when enough math is enough, or how much software engineering knowledge is needed to get hired? Bootcamps inaccurately make the promise that their students will get hired right after graduating. In most cases, this is only true for people with programming or mathematical backgrounds prior to enrolling. With that in mind, what steps should be taken prior and after taking a bootcamp? Objectives of Open Curriculai The content presented here is an attempt and a first iteration to help people get a better grasp as to how to navigate difficulties mentioned above. Open curricula refers to the fact that the initiative is open source, and that everyone has their optimal curriculum to follow - hence the plural form of the word \"Curriculum\". Main objectives : Inspire people who have never programmed but are interested in data science to take the leap and dive into the field. Assist anyone from total beginner, to bootcamp graduate, and everyone in between, to deepen their knowledge in the field so they can get hired as a data analyst, a data scientist, or a machine learning scientist. Attract experienced practitioners & teachers that are either looking for exceptional data science material or to help and mentor beginners. Incentivise people to discover and work on real world practical projects they are passionate about. Make it easy to find like-minded individuals to connect, study or work with by joining the community. Encourage people to develop skills such as public speaking, writing, creating presentations, and leadership.

Subscribe to Yannic Kilcher's Youtube channel for news related to the latest trends in the industry. He also explains and reviews newly published papers. Regularly explore Meetup.com to see if there are meetups on topics you are interested in. We have no recommendations since this is location dependant, but since Covid, some meetup groups are now 100% online - you potentially have access to meetups around the world. Attend conferences. One we highly suggest going to is Pycon , even if that means spending a bit of money to attend and travelling to a host city. The value you'll get from it will be worth it in our experience. It is a way for you to be inspired by all that is happening in the world of Python, engineering, and machine learning. Alternatively, you can get an online only ticket for cheaper. Participate in a Kaggle competition. Find a competition you're interested in joining - look for ones that are currently open/soon to open. Find teammates to work with, and start coding! Visit the Code section of the competition to read other competitor's notebooks. There are always people sharing interesting work. Participate in Hackathons. Keep an eye out for these events happening in your city, or look on meetup.com to find them. Actively look for and join communities on Reddit, Discord, and Slack. For instance, subscribe to Reddit's /r/learnmarchinelearning and /r/machinelearning subreddits. Join discord servers to find study groups so that you're not learning alone. Here's the link to our community's Discord Put yourself out there and start writing! Create a personal blog and write articles about what you learned. Your target audience should be people in the same situation you were in 6 months / 1 year ago. Find a meetup group and ask if you can present a subject you've been working on. Do the same within a bunch of different study groups. This will help your oral presentation skills. Keep an eye out for recruiting events in your area. Companies are always participating in these events. Update your CV and LinkedIn profile to match your studies and personal projects.
